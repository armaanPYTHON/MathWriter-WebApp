This application scans basic text for names of greek letters.
Once the required names that match the existing database are seperated, they are replaced with their universal text symbols.

These symbols can be copied and pasted onto most text applications and entry fields. For example, they can be used in word, email, whatsapp, etc.

This is the first prototype, and I am currently working on the second one.
Thank you.
